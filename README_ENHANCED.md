# Enhanced Your PaL MoE System

## Overview

This enhanced version of Your PaL MoE implements advanced features based on research insights from AFlow and SPO papers, while maintaining the original system's core strengths:

- **Cost optimization** through intelligent multi-tier provider routing
- **Go concurrency** with goroutines and channels for true parallelism  
- **Simple providers.csv** system for easy provider management
- **Enhanced intelligence** with task reasoning and self-optimization

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Intelligent Task Reasoning Engine
- **Complexity Analysis**: Analyzes reasoning, knowledge, computation, and coordination complexity
- **Domain Classification**: Identifies task domains (code, math, analysis, creative, business)
- **Intent Detection**: Classifies task intentions (generation, analysis, transformation, etc.)
- **Requirement Extraction**: Extracts quality levels, output formats, and constraints

### 2. Self-Supervised Prompt Optimization (SPO)
- **Iterative Optimization**: Improves prompts through multiple refinement rounds
- **Caching System**: Stores optimization results to avoid redundant processing
- **Cost-Aware**: Balances optimization effort with expected cost savings
- **Multiple Strategies**: Applies clarification, structure, context, constraints, and examples

### 3. Adaptive Provider Selection
- **Multi-Criteria Scoring**: Considers cost, performance, latency, and reliability
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Tracks provider performance and adapts selection
- **Complexity Alignment**: Matches provider tiers to task complexity
- **Alternative Options**: Provides fallback providers for resilience

### 4. Enhanced Pipeline Flow

```
